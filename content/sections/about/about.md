As a passionate entrepreneur, I'm all about using data-driven decision-making and machine learning to create positive change and value for impact-driven companies. With a strong foundation in key technologies like TF-DF, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib, I've honed my skills working with data from a variety of projects and building super-efficient trading bots.

My portfolio shows off my ability to apply these skills to real-world projects, including predicting restaurant revenues, where I used data to boost profitability and customer satisfaction. As a lifelong learner, I'm stoked to collaborate with like-minded pros to develop and produce machine learning models for entity resolution, software ecosystems, and data pipelines.

With a passion for innovation and a commitment to making a positive difference, I'm confident I can add value to any team that values creativity, innovation, and getting stuff done. I'm pumped to work with impact-driven companies focused on generating positive social, environmental, and economic impacts, and I'm excited to contribute to efforts aimed at creating a better world for all. Let's team up to create a brighter future today! :)
