As a driven entrepreneur, I strive to leverage data-driven decision making and machine learning to drive positive change and create value for impact-driven companies. With a strong foundation in key technologies such as TF-DF, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib, I have honed my skills through working with Titanic data and building a Bollinger trading bot.

My portfolio showcases my ability to apply my skills to real-world projects, including restaurant revenue prediction, where I used data to improve profitability and customer satisfaction. As a lifelong learner, I am excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals to develop and productionize machine learning models for entity resolution, software ecosystems, and data pipelines.

With a passion for innovation and a commitment to positive change, I am confident that I can bring value to any team that values creativity, innovation, and a commitment to making a difference. I am eager to work with impact-driven companies that are focused on generating positive social, environmental, and economic impacts, and I am excited to contribute to efforts aimed at creating a better world for all. Let's team up to create a brighter future today! :)
