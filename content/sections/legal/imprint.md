Liability for Contents
As the service provider, I am liable for the contents of my website according to Sec. 7, paragraph 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sec. 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service providers are not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to search for evidence that indicates illegal activities.

Legal obligations to remove information or to block the use of information remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of the law. Illegal contents will be removed immediately at the time I get knowledge of them.

Liability for Links
My offer includes links to external third-party websites. I have no influence on the contents of those websites, therefore I cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators of linked websites are always responsible for their own contents.

The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of the law. Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time I get knowledge of them.
